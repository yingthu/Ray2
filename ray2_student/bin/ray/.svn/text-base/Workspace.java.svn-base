/**
 * Each pixel requires a few data elements to compute the color.  Allocating them
 * new each pixel can be quite costly.  Further, each pixel is completely independent
 * so the data space could be reused each pixel without causing any computation errors.
 * By placing all the data elements into this short class, this working space can be
 * passed to the pixel shading method each time and avoid the unnecessary allocation.
